    "New York City and Toronto are financial centers of the United States and Canada, respectively. They both have a great diversity of multicultural places and venues. This is where I will leverage Foursquare. The purpose of this project is to compare New York and Toronto in terms of the popularity of venues and find out which venues tend to be most popular in each city. This project can be used by individuals looking to opening a business in either of those cities and find out which businesses/industries tend to be most popular in each city. "

    "The project will use data on New York city and Toronto. The NYC dataset was provided by \"IBM Data Science Professional Certificate\". The dataset includes columns on each neighborhood of New York City, their latitude and logitude, boroughs and zip codes. Data on Toronto's neighborhoods and zip codes was scraped from this wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M). Data on Toronto's corresponding latitudes and longitudes were provided by the IBM team as well as a csv file. \n",

    "The project explores data first on New York City and then on Toronto. The code is divided in two parts: the first one explores NYC data, narrows down search to include only Brooklyn neighborhoods, uses Folium to create map, creates five clusters of neighborhoods using K-clustering mechanism, and finally lists which venues are most popular in each cluster. The second part of the project carries out similar analysis for Toronto. In this case, data collection was different, however, after the dataframe was organized to include neighborhoods, boroughs, zip codes, latitudes, and longitudes, it was possible to do K-clustering and identify venues that are most frequent in Toronto's neighborhoods."

    "According to the analysis, the most popular venues in Brooklyn are bubble tea shops, spa, coffee shops, parks and harbors. In Toronto, the most common venues also tend to be coffee shops, clothing stores, cafes and pubs. Residents of both cities seem to be coffee-lovers but differ in other aspects. Investors considering starting a business in either New York or Toronto or both, should target coffee shops as potentially profitable business."

    "Both cities, as they are similar in being the financial capitals of the U.S. and Canada, are also similar in terms of the activities its residents like to perform and their tastes as well. Apart from the venues mentioned above, NYC residents enjoy chinese restaurants, pizza places, sushi restaurants, and Italian resturants. Residents of Toronto, alhtough agreeing with New Yorkers on sushi and Italian, prefer bakeries and bubble tea shops. "
